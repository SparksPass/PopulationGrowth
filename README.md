# PopulationGrowth
A python project which calculates population growth in countries
The program can calculate the exponential growth of any country by using the population and growth rate,
The progarm plugs all the data into a fromula (population * e ^ growth rate * t) and after the program then plots the population growth on a grid.
This can be done with many countries at once.
